\chapter{Introduction}
Open Computing Language (OpenCL) \citep{opencl} is a framework for platform-independent parallel programming across CPUs, GPUS and other discrete computing devices. OpenCL-based High Level Synthesis (HLS) frameworks is becoming mainstream for programming Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with the active support from major FPGAs vendors. \citep{rich2015how}
