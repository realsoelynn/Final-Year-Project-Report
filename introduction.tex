\chapter{Introduction}
Open Computing Language (OpenCL) \citep{opencl} is a framework for platform-independent parallel programming across CPUs, GPUS and other discrete computing devices. OpenCL-based High Level Synthesis (HLS) frameworks is becoming mainstream for programming Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with the active support from major FPGAs vendors. \citep{rich2015how}

\section{Background}


\section{Objective}
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning program to predict the optimization of the OpenCL-based HLS for FPGAs which in term will improve the performance of the program. The proposed program will streamline the machine learning on the OpenCL-based HLS data and reduce the time required to compile the program.
