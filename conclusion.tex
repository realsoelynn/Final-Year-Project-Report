\chapter{Conclusion}
The goal of the project was to develop a program to streamline the machine learning on the OpenCL-based HLS data. Seven metrics from the output of quartus OpenCL compiler are analysed and applied machine learning technique to predict the outcome of those seven metrics based on the features. We examined various classifiers. Neural Network classifier performed the best and it has average AUC score of 0.95 for classifying ALUTs, DSP Blocks, Logic Utilization, Memory Bits and Registers. Bagging and LogitBoosting classifier performed very close to one another with the average score of 0.97 and 0.96 respectively for classifying Kernel Fmax and RAM Blocks.
