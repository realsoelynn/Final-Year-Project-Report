OpenCL-based high-level synthesis framework is getting popular to used for programming FPGA as a number of commerical and research frameworks announced. We can improve the tuning of OpenCL compiler by predicting which pragma can improve the utilization of FPGA board such as Logic Utilization, Clock Frequency, etc. Currently, only two pragmas, num\_compute\_units and work group size, are tweaked and run different benchmarks. The compilation time is the barrier for the project and the data are not enough for the machine to learn.
