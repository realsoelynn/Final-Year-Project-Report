\chapter{Pre-processing Data}
In this project, we have the output data from quartus OpenCL compiler for three benchmarks: dfadd, dfsin and dfmul. Table \ref{table:benchmark_record} shows the number of data records for each benchmark.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} 
 \hline
 Benchmark & Record Count \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 dfmul & 20 \\ 
 \hline
 dfsin & 30 \\ 
 \hline
 dfadd & 48 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data set information}
\label{table:benchmark_record}
\end{table}

The data records for each benchmark are combined into a single csv file.

data\_formatter.py is written to consolidate the individual output data file from quartus OpenCL compiler into a single csv file. The command line interface is as follows:

\begin{minted}
{shell}
python data_formatter.py <input folder name> <output file name>
\end{minted}
