I would like to express my thank to Professor Nachiket Kapre who gave the opportunity to make this project through which I gained valuable knowledge. He has provided me with encouragement, support, and advice throughout my time at Nanyang Technological University. He inspired me both as a mentor and a person.

I am very grateful for the support provided by Andy Chong Chin Shin, Salihan, Nasruddin, Ang Wee Liang, Manoj and Su Su Htay. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends who supported me throughout this time.
