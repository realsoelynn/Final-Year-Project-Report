\chapter{Recommendations}

A few relevant problems remained unstudied. Here are areas that future studies could focus on:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Further studies should be carried out on the complete set of CHO benchmarks.
    \item If more data sets are available, we can train better model using stacking or deep learning.
\end{enumerate}
