\chapter{Recommendations}

A few relevant problems remained unstudied. Here are areas that future studies could focus on:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item All the CHO benchmarks were not completed as the computing power required to run the data before the deadline of this project is impossible.
    \item If more data sets are available, we can train better model using stacking, ensemble or deep learning.
\end{enumerate}
