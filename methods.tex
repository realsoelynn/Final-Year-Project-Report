\section{Descriptions of Data}
Data sets to be analysed were the simulated results of OpenCL CHO benchmarks on FPGA board. Data in each file can be categorised into three sections: pragma values, estimated resource usage summary and the detailed resource usage. Figure \ref{figure:sample_raw_data} is an instance of the data set.
